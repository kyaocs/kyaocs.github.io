I am currently a lecturer in the School of Computer Science at Sichuan Normal University. I joined Sichuan Normal University in January 2024. Prior to that, I worked as a Postdoc at the University of Sydney from March 2023 to December 2023. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the same school in March 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. Lijun Chang](https://lijunchang.github.io/index.html).
